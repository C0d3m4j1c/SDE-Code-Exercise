# SDE-Code-Exercise
This project was created using typescript, the scaffolding under the src folder is models, tests, types, and utils. 
The external package that I used was the ```munkres-js``` which allows me to use 
[The Munkres Assignment Algorithm Hungarian Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ5MsiGaDY8) 
to attempt to improve the efficiency of assigning drivers x shipments address.

## Steps to run the project

1. Clone the project
2. CD into the project folder 
3. ```npm i ```
4. ```npm run build``` so the dist folder is created
5. ```npm run start``` so the code in dist is executed.
6. Optional step ```npm run test``` to execute the unit tests
7. Optional step modifies the files shipments.txt and drivers.txt so you can test out a different set of drivers x shipments address

### Aditional notes

The project was a fun challenge, and although not completely finished as I would like I took the decision to deliver something than keep overengineering it at the end of the day this is just a simple first step in a series of interviews. 

Thank you.
